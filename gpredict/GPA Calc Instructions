Instructions:

This GPA calculator has two primary features.

1. It allows you to enter your current grades along with the number of
units of said grades to calculate your current GPA.

If you want to calculate your GPA, enter commands in the following order:

>> calculate *grade* *units* *grade* *units*

Eg. If you had 4 units of A's and 12 units of B+'s, you would enter the following:

>> calculate A 4 B+ 12

2. It allows you to enter a desired GPA, along with a preferred grade you would
want to achieve in order to get that GPA, along with the number of semesters you
want to achieve this GPA by. It then tells you whether or not this goal is possible,
and if possible, it tells you how many units of said grade you would have to achieve
on average per semester to reach your desired GPA.

Let us understand through an example. Say someone had 4 units of A's, 3 units of A-'s,
and 12 units of B's right now. Say they had a desired GPA of 3.8 and they wanted to achieve
this GPA by scoring all A-'s. This means A- is their preferred grade. They then wish to do so
in 3 semesters. Based on these parameters, the person would enter the following commands:

>> predict A 4 A- 3 B 12 3.8 3 A-

The program would then either determine whether this was possible or not (in this case
it is possible) and would spit out the following output:

Your current GPA is 3.3210526315789473
To achieve a desired GPA of 3.8
Over a total of 3 semester(s)
Assuming your goal is to get all A-'s
You must get:
91 units worth of A-'s
At an average of 30.33 units of A-'s per semester.
